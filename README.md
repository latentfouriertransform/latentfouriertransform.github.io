## Customization

The HTML file has TODO comments showing what to replace:

- Paper title, authors, institution, conference
- Links (arXiv, GitHub, etc.)
- Abstract and descriptions  
- Videos, images, and PDFs
- Related works in the dropdown
- Meta tags for SEO and social sharing

### Meta Tags
The template includes meta tags for better search engine visibility and social media sharing. These appear in the `<head>` section and help with:
- Google Scholar indexing
- Social media previews (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn)
- Search engine optimization

Create a 1200x630px social preview image at `static/images/social_preview.png`.

## Tips

- Compress images with [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com)
- Use YouTube for large videos (>10MB)
